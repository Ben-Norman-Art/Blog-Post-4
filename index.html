<p class="Group, TabTwo" style="color:white">These were the two out of the three games I played within this lab. Each one has the aesthetic of fantasy within them respectfully. While both do have an interactive aspect to the Fantasy world they create they each have their own aesthetics of their own. While Sort The Court is a Fantasy primarily due to the factor of the player being a leader a kingdom. There seems to be a bit more of a narrative especially with each interaction with a civilian in the kingdom. As well as having a more Submission/Abnegtion to the game due to the fact that there seems to be no end and each interaction with a citizen is different no matter how often you see the person, creature, monster. This differs from HeterogenyWIP due to the fact that with this game the Fantasy aesthetic comes from the player not just playing one character but multiple. However, there is not that much of a narrative aspect within the game. As told both of these games would be considered fantasy due to the player in each game being able to play characters the wouldn't be able to play in the real world.

This game has the aesthetic, similarly to the Sort the Court, of being a Submission/Abnegation. With the main focus having the player spend time investing time into getting more paperclips and selling them. It gives players pass time will also somewhat teaching them about currency and other business aspects. This game does not seem to focus on the other aesthetics. Therefore the primary aesthetic would be Submission or Abnegation.
